ArduinoFX-server
================

Embedded Server side for ArduinoFX project

1. Basic Hardware Setup

Arduino Uno with RHT03 temperature and relative humidity sensor and a XBee antenna plugged in an Arduino shield. 

The measures are sent wirelessly to a second XBee antenna, plugged via a XBee Explorer to a Raspberry Pi USB port.

In the Raspberry Pi, with soft-float Debian wheezy distro, we have installed Java Embedded Suite 7.0.

2. Embedded Server

This code allows you to create the embedded server in the Raspberry Pi

It will perform the following main tasks: 

-Back-end task: it will repeatedly read the serial port to get the measures from the Arduino and store them in a database.
    
-Web services: it will respond to web requests returning the current values measured.

-RESTful web services: it will respond to REST requests returning lists in json format with the data measured between two dates.

for full explanation on the embedded server installation. 

These tasks are intended for a JavaFX based client (https://github.com/jperedadnr/ArduinoFX-client)
